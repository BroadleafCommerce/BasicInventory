The basic inventory module is intended for lower volume sites where inventory is managed as a single value at the Sku level. This module does not attempt to prevent concurrent inventory modification, which is why this module is better suited for lower volume sites.  Broadleaf Commerce is developing an Advanced Inventory module that will have substantially more functionality, and will prevent the possibility of inacurate inventory due to concurrent modification of inventory values.
